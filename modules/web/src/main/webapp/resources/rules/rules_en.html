    Two to four players play by forming words from individual lettered
    tiles on a game board marked with a 15-by-15 grid. The words are
    formed across and down in crossword fashion and must appear in a
    standard dictionary and players collect points by placing its on the
    game board. The object of Scribble is to score more points than one's
    opponent. Each letter has a different point value, so the strategy
    becomes to play words with high scoring letter combinations.</P>
